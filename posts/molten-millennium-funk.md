The Ram Trilogy project and the Molten Beats album was a meeting of the minds. Having already been following and impacting the evolution of rave sounds from hardcore days in the early 90s thru jungle's emergence and morphing into rapidly changing stages of drum & bass styles they had all appeared in various duo's on some of Ram's releases and compilation albums. In recent years Ram's sound had started to really hone in on a distinct drum & bass flavour featuring heavy sub-bass, stepping beats, and sci-fi edges. Ram Trilogy brought them together in the studio to build further on the sound. Ant's raw punk ethos brought gritty, hard-hitting drumwork. Andy's bass-focused rave energy and dancefloor groove wisdom. Shimon's strength a bringing a strong funk to tunes. With production levels all firing at their top, the result was tunes that banged drums, twisted distorted electronics and were driven by large basslines. This was drum & bass not just following the late-90s techy trends of the underground but raising the bar to their own unique level. The global popularity of drum & bass including the mutated techstep sounds of neurofunk spreading, were all contributing to a rising temperature at the turn of the millennium and the Ram trio was there to melt parties with their Molten funk template.

#﻿#### The Mix

I﻿ncluded on the CD version of the album


the mix, as you'd hear the many chapters and dubplates in the months leading up, represents the sound well. Not just because of it's combination of sound but also Andy 'The Executioner' C as the top rated DJ in the game a perfect choice to rep to shell the tunes down well.
