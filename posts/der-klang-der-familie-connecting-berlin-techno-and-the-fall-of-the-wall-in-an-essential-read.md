lead: On November 9, 1989 the Berlin Wall came down and the lives of East and
  West Germans separated by years of Cold War division were thrust together
  overnight. The sudden change to the cityscape, a new world of free-moving
  neighbours that seemed strange, presented an opportunity for the youth of the
  day. A myriad of spaces became available to discover, explore and yes, party
  in. Men and women, straight and gay, from East and West Berlin, were coming
  together and the exciting new time of unification was also fostering an
  equally exciting new soundtrack - <strong>the sound of techno</strong>.
summary: 9th November - 31 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall. 31 Jahre
  Mauerfall. Nothing more fitting to mark the anniversary than this book, Der
  Klang Der Familie, that connects Berlin, techno and the reunification time
  into an essential read.

The book *Der Klang Der Familie* by Felix Denk and Sven von Thülen chronicles the fascinating development of music and culture that rapidly rose out of that time of change in Berlin and is a perfect read on the anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, 31 years ago today. The immense impact of the event on Berlin and European society cannot be understated. But what is really interesting is the role the new and evolving musical movement of techno played in shaping a foundational cultural identity in Berlin. From its origins in Detroit, techno jumped across the ocean to a city newly reunified and open to form a sort of symbiotic relationship. The burgeoning scene continued the growth and spread around the world of the music and helped establish Berlin's place throughout the years as a major epicenter of the global scene.

I cannot say enough about *Der Klang Der Familie* which uses an oral history format to reveal tons of stories from interviews with many key players from the time. What started as a project to document the history of pivotal Berlin club Tresor soon branched out to encompass other influential parties and clubs like E-werk and UFO, Berlin techno music history and the common thread of their origin stories became clearly tied to the fall of the Wall. The book connects elements of underground dance music, rave & club culture and the greater societal and geopolitical changes in Germany and the world into a document of foundational culture. Essential read to say the least!

*Der Klang Der Familie* (The Sound of Family) gets its title from a track released on Tresor Records in 1992 by 3Phase featuring Dr. Motte. The book has been translated from the original German into many languages including the very successful English edition which was released to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. Here we are at the 31st anniversary and I finally got myself a copy ;)
