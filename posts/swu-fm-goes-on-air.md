  SWU.FM starts broadcasting & beaming to the community & world today. From
  beginnings as a temporary exhibition to getting public support for the station
  and being awarded an FM license, building the studio, and covid launch delays
  â€“it's been a journey for hard-working heads like Ollie and the team for sure.
  In this social media age we were able to have some documentation and glimpses
  of the development and passion at work from the ground up which was nice!
summary: SWU.FM a new radio station in Bristol is on the air officially &
  legally after a long building process and looks to draw from the rich pool of
  underground dance music artists and soundsystem culture roots of the community
  for an exciting launch.

With a pirate radio ethos, rich underground culture and pool of artists in Bristol to draw from, and even Rinse FM design sensibilities by Give Up Art, exciting SWU.FM times lie ahead connecting & sharing in the scene together. I have always said radio is a great way to keep in touch with the scene when not partying and we could all use some more positive frequencies uniting us right now. Congrats all. 

The lineup of shows includes Bristol local talent and legends alike. A great mix of dance and urban styles will be on display from dubstep, uk garage, jungle/drum'n'bass, reggae, house and techno, all very much connected to the rave & dance heritage and soundsystem culture heritage of the city. A few that will be dropping in for regular shows include Addison Groove, DJ Die/GutterFunk, Om Unit, Jakes, DJ Dazee, and Sam Binga!
