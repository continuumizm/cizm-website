Really can't talk about #303day without mentioning London Acid Techno - the music and scene of the mid-90s and on that revolved around fast, hard techno beats with grinding, raw, dirty 303 acid lines, and underground parties of squats, drugs, travelers and sound systems - epitomized by the 1997 compilation It's Not Intelligent...And It's Not From Detroit...But It's F**king 'avin It!

raw

tight knit group of producers all making tracks and collaborating and running a slew of labels. Production was raw, but very good. Strong beats and 303 basslines maximized to effect, many of the tunes were a force to be reckoned with. Closer to the hard trance scene the sounds and djs circulated amongst the same flyers and releases sometimes. It was the purely dance driven, raw techno sound that was appealing. While the outside dance scene evolved to include things like things like super clubs, trance becoming mainstream, and even the broader techno scene heavily rooted in trends from Detroit, the acid techno scene carved a niche out for itself representing another segment of partying and society even.

Lochi's London Acid City became an anthem both for the free party scene and the community that existed in and around it. A protest movement in London in 1996 called "Reclaim The Streets" would blare it during street marches, it's simple but effective 303 loop and vocal snippet "Our Time Is Now" capturing imaginations and moving feet. When it came time to collect some of the many underground vinyl hits into a more 'mainstream' release, a cd compilation, the Liberator's Stay Up Forever label lead the compilation with the track.

Have to note that later it became apparent that there was all kinds of scenes farther into eastern europe in places like Poland where acid techno was played regularly by djs at parties in fields and well, anywhere that rules are a bit more lax and the culture is a bit more free-for-all, could be a place for acid techno to thrive and rock it!

The party scene thrived and required constant new releases. Things seem to roll along with even another massive hit "One Night In Hackney" causing waves until around the mid-2000s when apparently the scene got a bit darker and weighed down by drug influences, and the party scene likely threatened by London gentrification etc. I lost track of it as the releases became less frequent and the pressure elsewhere from the global techno scene's shift to minimal, slower sounds, no doubt affected how things went. Thing is, the music with it's simple array of tools, 303 basslines and hard pumping beats, and focus on having a good time and the parties, made it kind of timeless. Returning to these sounds still make you want to dance and you can appreciate a good acid line anytime.
