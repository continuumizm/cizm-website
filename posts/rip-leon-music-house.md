lead: Many across a number of scenes, particularly drum & bass, mourned at the
  sudden loss of Leon Chu (after a battle with cancer). A behind-the-scenes
  character who worked at the famous Music House cutting studios making

  House was a key part of the jungle and drum & bass scene as it grew and
  evolved with Leon cutting plates giving support and focus as well as it
  becoming a storied social meeting point for key scenesters.
