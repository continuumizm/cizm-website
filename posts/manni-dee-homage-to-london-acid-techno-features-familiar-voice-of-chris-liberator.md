Yes, that's none other than Chris Liberator providing vocals for a great 'homage to acid techno' tune featured on Manni Dee's new album of tougher sounds on the Perc Trax label. The style and pace of the kick drum was immediately eyebrow raising upon hearing it and nice to see the acid techno legend involved.
