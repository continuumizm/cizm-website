Many across the scene were stunned at the unexpected news and totally gutted to have lost a character and contributor such as Marcus. Producing tunes from early jungle years and running a label and events later including active radio shows and DJing around the world also. He most often remembered as key in massively influencing DNB at a time when soulful 'liquid' sounds rose to prominence in the early 00's. He always continued to push forward-thinking sounds while holding on to the roots. Injecting soul and personality, he just loved the music.

Digging into the archives for a mix that exemplifies the journey thru influences and inspirations that Intalex drew from is how I like to remember him. Back when he was about to release his debut album '21' Marcus recorded this mix to feature some of the sounds that shaped his 21 years in music and shaped the scene around him. From early techno and house to hardcore and jungle, these sounds influenced his evolution as he went on to produce new sounds and inspire others to draw on the same and the mix provides a great touching off point for this blog exploring that continuum.

Take a trip across a small part of history with some expert selections along with some brief commentary (sobering to hear his voice) from the great Marcus Intalex. RIP.
