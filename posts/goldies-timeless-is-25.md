lead: Already a much-lauded part of DNB and dance music history, Goldie's
  "Timeless" album, with its instrumentation, strings and elaborate
  arrangements, seemed destined for something more.
summary: 25 years since the landmark album was released, reflecting on its
  incarnation as a live orchestra performance, a natural next level I was lucky
  to attend the first show of in London in 2014.

Goldie set out in 2014 to realize the music as a live orchestral performance. Working with the Heritage Orchestra, the album found its natural next level. I was lucky to witness the first live performance in London (thanks to a last minute tip from Metalheadz DJ and scene legend DJ Flight). The album's place in history and connection to the culture of the city and beyond could be felt. The audience was on its feet for most of the performance, unified in admiration for the music and the man himself. The meaning of the music and place in people's hearts as the epic journey of the album played out in front of us in a new but familiar way that felt so fitting. It was emotional.
