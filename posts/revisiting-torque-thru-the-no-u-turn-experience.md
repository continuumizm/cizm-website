  started by Nico Sykes, developed progressively darker jungle sounds in the
  mid-90s that evolved into some of the darkest techstep that came to the fore
  on the label's landmark compilation 'Torque' in 1997. Fueled by creative
  inspiration and experimentation shared in the studio together, sounds that
  Nico, Trace, Fierce and Ed Rush had been putting out were part of a continued
  charge into a two-step break-focused, dark experimental bassline, raw almost
  industrial drum'n'bass sound. With releases also on other labels like
  Metalheadz and Emotif and support of the direction from Grooverider and his
  Prototype Recordings, the sounds of a constantly evolving scene changed again
  in a techstep revolution.
summary: 'To get the full feel for Torque was to hear bits in the mix. Ed Rush &
  Trace played a "No U-Turn Experience" mix on One In The Jungle BBC Radio 1 in
  1997 before the landmark compilation LP came out. A big deal: the NUT techstep
  drum & bass sound on display to the world.'

The Torque LP presented the hardest, darkest techstep around bringing the No U-Turn ideas to the mainstream. The album is often cited as an alluring introduction to DnB at the time for some people, and even today being referenced as inspiration for producers looking to return to a more raw, techy sound.

  <p class="text-secondary text-left small" style="font-size:0.7rem;">Ed Rush's techstep sound was embraced by other labels like Metalheadz at the same time. The cover of 'Skylab' (METH024) shows a Headz logo over a satellite image of Detroit (upside down?). Never realized what it was all these years! Just assumed it was a shot of London or something. But the visionary design of Magnet Studio on Headz releases at the time ties in Ed Rush's interest in connecting the sounds back to the original Detroit Techno blueprint. An approach he would continue to promote with other new producers emerging from No U-Turn like Optical. The duo would go on only a year later to break further ground with a more electronic funk/techno influenced techstep sound on their Virus Recordings imprint and the album Wormhole to massive acclaim.</p>

**To get the full feel for *Torque* was to hear bits in the mix.** Hearing the sounds and some of the standout tracks from the compilation blended with their cutting edge contemporaries was the best way to get the true vibe. Ed Rush & Trace did a B2B guest mix with MC Navigator on the BBC Radio 1 *One In The Jungle* show right before the album was released called *The No U-Turn Experience*. The NUT sound on display to the world, the mix showcases more than No U-Turn tracks including similar artists pushing the new progressive sound like Dillinja, Doc Scott, Boymerang and other releases of Ed Rush, Trace & friends on labels like Prototype. 

Check out *The No U-Turn Experience* set from 7th February 1997, a snapshot of techstep experimentation and new avenues:
