lead: On September 9th we celebrate the Roland TR-909 drum machine whose tough
  kicks and crisp hi-hats we owe almost everything to as foundations of techno
  and dance music. The real nod must be given to those that put the machines
  into action and that's the focus of the coming soon documentary God Said Give
  'Em Drum Machines.

The film which has been in the works for a number of years and will finally see light of day next year goes deep into the story of Detroit techno through interviews with it's key figures and artists from around the scene. Touching not just on the story of the music, which the 909 was a pivotal tool, but shining light on its pioneering heroes whose significant cultural contribution is often overlooked/forgotten in the global electronic music industry and business that developed since. It is important to not only share the history of the music so many of us enjoy but also highlight and celebrate its Black origins, an all too relevant point into today's heightened atmosphere pushing for more support and recognition of Black artists and culture.

So on #909Day here's to the drum machine and Black techno culture from Detroit! Can't wait to see the doc!
