A cassette tape (yep, those days) once came with an issue of Muzik Magazine in 1998 that had a slice of his renowned Balearic vibes. It became my go-to "post-rave" mix. You know the kind - something to throw on after a party when you finally make it home at some daytime hour, bringing the BPMs down, as you head towards bed for recovery. This tape was a perfect length megamix, soundtracking the drift into many a deep slumber. Hearing it now is triggering echoes from my REM subconscious. RIP José.
